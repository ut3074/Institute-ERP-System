The digitization of the Education System is happening fast. A major result of this transformation from paper to electronic records is the proliferation of students data and with that of course, comes the student database(ERP System).
The ERP system is a big and ambitious project, with the help of this website Faculties can see the students data who have registered in the website and can see internal details in the database. Students can view their details anytime. This project helps in serving the colleges. I am thankful for being provided this great opportunity to work on it.
